</div><div>- Don't read too much into the exact wording. The English wording is my own. If you want clarification on anything at all, let me know and I can explain what I understand from the original Japanese in more detail.
</div><div>
</div><div>- Where lines of dialogue are quoted from the games, I decided not to just paste in the dialogue that was used in the English versions. Thought it would be more interesting to translate the Japanese lines the way they're written in the book. After all you can easily find the English dialogue online if you want it.

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Existing in the heart forever, the pure love of a mother
<div>
</div><div>- Trish was made by Mundus as a living copy of Dante's mother, as bait to lure Dante out. When the two of them met, there was a gruesome battle, covered with the spray of blood. Mundus' plan worked wonderfully; when Dante saw that Trish had his mother's face, he started to trust her. However, we should not immediately label Dante with a mother-complex* here. He certainly doesn't depend on Trish as his mother. He definitely projects his longing for his mother onto Trish, as for Dante, his mother is something that must be protected. But Dante doesn't have anything like the feeling of living under his mother's protection as with what's normally called a mother-complex. Once, he was unable to protect his mother and let her die. Even while knowing that Trish is not his mother, he is determined to protect her. Here, from this regret that he was unable to protect his mother, there was definitely a certain kind of "feeling" for Trish. Because of this, her betrayal of Dante was particularly painful. After being trapped by Trish, Dante says:
</div><div>
</div><div>You looked like my mother.
</div><div>Now, disappear.
</div><div>The next time won't be like this. 
</div><div>
</div><div>- As would be expected of Dante, heir of a demon line who coolly cuts down his enemies, he doesn't show a single tear - but he was wounded to the bottom of his heart. After turning his back to Trish, he was crying...
</div><div>
</div><div>- On the one hand, Trish was born as a puppet for Mundus, and like other low-grade demons such as Marionettes she exists only to be manipulated by him. However, the seeds of Dante's love gradually bud in her heart. This phenomenon can only be called a miracle. Trish is nothing but an empty "container". But from this doll who wears enough meat to pose as Dante's mother, a partnership arises. And so she gives her final breath protecting Dante from Mundus' fatal blow. From her self-sacrificing actions, Dante sees her as a human for the first time. Dante leaves his mother's keepsake amulet beside Trish's corpse. The tears he cries fall onto Trish's face. At this point, she becomes a true "human" with a heart of her own. And as Dante faces Mundus in their final decisive battle, the revived Trish appears before Dante to give him courage like his mother. This is also a miracle. A mother's thoughts of watching over her child. A child's heart yearning to protect its mother. Even the Demon Emperor is powerless in the face of such strong love. Let's consider something here. What if Dante's mother had been the demon, and his father a human - would a human's fatherly love have been able to save his child, Dante? We can't help but feel that it wouldn't. There's no clear reason for this. We can only say one thing: that is, that mothers are powerful. Of course, after this, Trish having obtained proof of her humanity through her own tears, it goes without saying that Dante loves Trish as an individual woman.

            <div class="title col-12 col-md-8">
                <h2 class="align-center pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">D E V I L M A Y C R Y  3 :  O V E R V I E W</h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">- In "Devil May Cry", Dante defeated the Demon Emperor Mundus. In the process of that battle, he was forced to bury his older brother Vergil (Nelo Angelo). "Devil May Cry 3" depicts earlier days. The Dante appearing in this game is of course younger. The way he plays the guitar, the way he acts like a rockstar, is definitely playing up to an audience - the player.
<div>
</div><div>- What confronts this younger Dante is his brother Vergil. Dante, who wants to continue being human, confronts his brother Vergil, who seeks demonic power. Dante and Vergil cross swords right from the start. This grand sibling rivalry is a beautifully raw expression of irreparable conflict between comrades at antitheses. Also, in this story, there is another pair of of foes depicted: Arkham and Lady. Arkham wants to become a god by obtaining the power of Sparda, and to satisfy this ambition he kills his wife, and intends to offer his daughter up as a sacrifice. So, Lady kills her father with her own hands. Here once again, a sad case of an unrecoverable rivalry is depicted. A deep-rooted blood feud. This unbearable hatred grows out of love, and even this is a very human feeling. Lady, of course, is proof that Dante and Vergil are also human. Even Arkham, who is so cold that he would sacrifice a blood relative, has desires that are truly human. Even if it's about inheriting the blood of demons, even if it's about seeking the power of demons, "Devil May Cry 3" depicts conflicts between one person and another.
</div><div>
</div><div>- In the final scene, Vergil alone was left in the demon world. When Vergil sent Dante back to the human world, this was not because he wanted to keep the power of the demon world to himself - rather, it was his wish that Dante continue to live as a human. That's how this should be interpreted. After this, Vergil, alone in the demon world, resolutely challenges Mundus to battle, and the curtain is closed on the story. The result of this battle is made evident in the first game, "Devil May Cry". It ends in Vergil's defeat. And then Vergil is made into Mundus' puppet, and directs his blade at Dante...
</div><div>
</div><div>- The stage where these clashes of opposite purposes occur is the tower of Temen-ni-gru. We have to explain the reference behind this tower that links the demon world with the human world.
</div><div>
</div><div>- The root of the name Temen-ni-gru is E-temen-anki 
</div><div>
</div><div>This refers to the towering temple constructed by the Sumerian people in Mesopotamian culture, and also can be thought of as having the same meaning as the Tower of Babel that appears in Genesis in the Old Testament. E-Temen-Anki / The Tower of Babel is a ziggurat (stair-shaped building) of the kind that is often seen in Mesopotamian culture, and closely resembles Temen-ni-gru as it is depicted in-game.
</div><div>
</div><div>- And not just in its outward appearance - the role that Temen-ni-gru was to accomplish also recalls the purpose of the Tower of Babel. The Tower of Babel, constructed in the Mesopotamian capital Babylon, was constructed in human arrogance, trying to reach the heavens. This angered god, who gave humans differing languages. As a consequence, confusion ensued, and in order to gather groups that spoke the same language, humans had to scatter all over the world. In Genesis, the name Babel has another meaning attached, that of confusion, and in "Devil May Cry 3" when Arkham unseals Temen-ni-gru he says:
</div><div>
</div><div>The seal has been undone.
</div><div>After this, what do you think will happen?
</div><div>Chaos will come!
</div><div>
</div><div>- Like the humans who were punished for trying to approach god, he wants to become a god himself. From Arkham's mouth comes the curse of chaos. Temen-ni-gru, which stretches from the human world to the demon world, is the tower that brings forth chaos.
</div><div>All these human desires have sounded the bell of chaos.
</div><div>Two thousand years have passed -
</div><div>The closed door to the demon world has once again been opened.
</div><div>Temen-ni-gru is the "Foundation of Terror"
</div><div>Just like its name!
</div><div>And I will become the ruler of the world of chaos!
</div><div>
</div><div>- Here there is one more matter we must touch on: Arkham's words, 'All these human desires have sounded the bell of chaos.' At the peak of Temen-ni-gru, which has opened the gates to the demon world, there appear bells that symbolise the 7 deadly sins: Pride (gouman), Envy (shitto), Wrath (fundo), Sloth (taida), Greed (gouyoku), Gluttony (boushoku), and Lust (shikiyoku). In Dante Alighieri's "Divine Comedy", the protagonist, having had the mark of the deadly sins carved into him 7 times at the gates of purgatory, makes his way around the mountain of purgatory to erase his sins. In "Devil May Cry 3", Arkham has the marks of the sins, and Dante, having plunged into the demon world (purgatory), erases the sins of Arkham (the human).

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">This article alternatively uses both the Japanese word meaning shadow (kage) and a phonetic spelling of the English word (shadow) in Japanese characters. For anyone who cares about the distinction, I used a capital S for the latter case, and a lower case s when the Japanese word was used.
<div>
</div><div>The shadow, always hiding in your inner consciousness
</div><div>
</div><div>In dreams, characters whose actions are completely different, things we could never do ourselves, appear. Often they make our dreaming self-nervous. They can take the faces of friends we know well, and there are also times when we wonder why we cannot remember their faces. According to the 6 dream archetypes classified by – External Ink - this is called the Shadow. Things such as the environment a person is born and grows up in, and their own true nature, shape its character. No matter how kind or sympathetic to other people our character grows to be, the cold-hearted, cruel, and selfish parts will never disappear. They will live on quietly in our unconscious. That which we would call our hidden character, is the Shadow.
</div><div>Couldn't we think of Dante and Vergil from "Devil May Cry 3" as each existing as the other's Shadow? In the scene with the final confrontation over the amulets, Dante says to Vergil, who hopes to gain father's mighty power:
</div><div>If we are the sons of Sparda,
</div><div>what we are successors to isn't his power!
</div><div>More importantly - it's his proud soul!
</div><div>
</div><div>Sorry, but this is what my soul is saying - more power!
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Also, supplementing Vergil's lines, earlier before this battle, he says:
</div><div>
</div><div>Power controls everything.
</div><div>Without power, one cannot protect anything
</div><div>
</div><div>And in the final scene:
</div><div>
</div><div>I'm fine here. In this place, father's home. *
</div><div>
</div><div>Just like Dante, Vergil wanted to protect Eva, and also you can see his sense of reverence for his father Sparda. This is not merely a picture of polar opposites with Dante = Good and Vergil = Evil. Their love for their parents is the same, but the most important part of their father's legacy is for Dante, his soul, and for Vergil, his power. Sparda and Eva would have treated the brothers equally, but the fact that their mother was killed trying to protect her children was a turning point for the twins, and it seems that after that their lives were divided. The shadows come from one source. There are two shadows growing from the feet of the "Sons of Sparda," one is the "soul," Dante, and the other is the "power," Vergil. As the years passed these shadows grew larger, to the point where one can't help but be conscious of them. They are twins, they are one another's other-self, which is to say they should have to seek each other out, but they irritate and are incompatible. Their ways of life and their ways of fighting have both come to parallel their respective intentions.
</div><div>
</div><div>- The battle where Dante and Vergil place themselves on opposite sides is a battle with one's other self. Dante and Vergil are each other's shadows, and at the same time each other's light. The relationship between Dante and Vergil is such that each of their selves are formed due to the other's existence.
</div><div>
</div><div>* The word Vergil uses for father is oyaji which isn't actually as stuffy/formal as father sounds in English. But it sounded too weird to make Vergil say dad .

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Dante's older twin brother. In contrast to Dante, he is the type who dislikes a commotion. He seeks power as a demon successor to Sparda, and plots to open the gate to the demon world with Arkham. However, Vergil is also a successor to Sparda's bloodline. Certainly, it is not the case that he desires demonic power in order to invade* the human world - his desire for power comes from a genuine feeling of wanting to become stronger. As a result, he is used by Arkham, and he alone falls into the demon world, where he challenges Mundus to battle, but is defeated.
<div>
</div><div>* Invade, raid, or show agression towards. That is to say, Vergil has no aggressive intentions towards the human world.

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">To search out his mother's killers, Dante plans to open a convenience store. Just before the curtain opens on his lonely battle, an invitation to a "happening party" reaches him from his older brother Vergil, who has chosen a different path in life, and he heads towards Temen-ni-gru. Having met a woman called Lady who burns to take vengeance on her father for killing her mother, he comes to his senses regarding his own family - his conflict with his brother, and his thoughts about his parents. Eventually, with the same justice that penetrated Sparda, he chooses to walk the path of protecting the weak.</h3>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Arkham's daughter - her real name is Mary. However, when she met Dante she wouldn't identify herself, and was called ojouchan (Lady) by Dante. She pursues her father, who killed her mother, to Temen-ni-gru. She must realise her revenge with her own hands. This, according to her, is "family business". After shooting Arkham, who had fallen from the demon world following his defeat to Dante and Vergil, tears flowed from her eyes. Even while bathing her body in blood with the demonic act of killing her own father, she shows proof that she is "human" and cannot be evil.

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">A worshipper of demons, he plans to make Sparda's power his own. He uses the half-human, half-demon Vergil to call to Dante, and personally lures out his daughter Lady who bears a grudge about her mother's death. All this to open the gates to the demon world. His scheme to fill the world with chaos, and himself become a god, progressed as expected - but he could not have predicted the might of Sparda's power. After releasing the seal, Arkham couldn't control it and transformed into an ugly monster. And so, he was fought by Dante and Vergil, fell from the demon world, and was eternally put to rest at the hands of his own daughter.</h3>
